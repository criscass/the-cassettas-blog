Sophia and I arrived at Amsterdam Schiphol after a peaceful flight of about two hours. Hilly and Gemma will join us by car at the end of the month.

I slept through the entire flight; I was dead tired because the last few days have been really hectic. We tried to organize as much as possible in advance, but in the end, a lot of things accumulated that we had underestimated or not even planned for. We sold quite a few things we had accumulated over the years; many we gave away to friends or charities.

We stored a small quantity of items that we particularly care about in a space kindly provided by friends in Castelfiorentino (thanks, Luigi and Rita), and we plan to go back to retrieve them as soon as we have a house, hopefully before school starts at the end of August.

Now I am writing this post lying on the bed of the Amrath Media Park Hotel in Hilversum, about 35 km southeast of Amsterdam. We just had a hearty dinner at a Vietnamese restaurant where we messed up our order and ended up with a mountain of food, thankfully it was all really good. We brought the leftovers back to the hotel and will eat them for lunch tomorrow.

At the hotel reception, there is a South African girl from Johannesburg, and Sophia chatted with her a bit in Afrikaans. She asked if people in Italy are more cheerful and welcoming than people in the Netherlands because she misses the warmth of South Africans. We replied that it depends on which part of Italy you go to; there’s a big difference between Trentino and Campania, for instance.

When she learned that we are immigrating and looking for work, she immediately said that they are looking for employees and we could apply to work there. I told her that we want to try other careers first, but that in the future we might consider working in hospitality, just not now.

Tomorrow early afternoon, we will take the train and go to Huizen, an old fisherman town between Amsterdam and Utrecht, where we will start our first “pet sitting.” We will stay at Liz’s house and take care of a beagle named Bob and a cat named Morris.
