I'll start this post with interviews with the members of the Cassetta family.

We'll begin with the captain, the one who steers the ship with a firm hand and total dedication. No, just kidding, it's not like that at all. In this and previous adventures, we have always reflected on and decided every little move together.

I've prepared some questions that I think can help reveal what the other Cassettas think and feel.

Today is Tuesday, I'm off work and Hilly is working this afternoon. The girls are at school and we are having breakfast with cheese eggs on whole-wheat toast and coffee.

Outside is the usual grey sky and drizzle that comes and goes, but the temperature is not cold at all.

Let's start with the questions.

**C: - You've been in the Netherlands for more than 17 months. Do you still think you made the right choice?**

**H:** Yes. There are days when I doubt the decision we made, but if I listen to my mind, and not my heart, I know I made the right choice.

**C: But the common saying is usually: "Listen to your heart!".**

**H:** If I think about my friends in Italy, and the life we left behind, and it's cold here and the sun isn't shining and I have to face the darkness and rain in the morning to go to a job I don't find stimulating or interesting, then I feel the doubt inside me that I might have made the wrong choice, maybe.\
But then, if I think rationally, and repeat to myself the reasons why we came here and the fact that it's only 17 months, and things will get easier, then I know I made the right decision.

**C: And what would be the reasons why we made this choice?**

**H:** To give our daughters different opportunities, to broaden our horizons (all four of us), and to challenge ourselves.

**C: Tell me 5 things you appreciate about the Netherlands.**

**H:**

1. It's extremely easy to get everywhere by bike.
2. Almost everything works perfectly.
3. Daily bureaucracy and administration are easy.
4. People generally have good will to help you find solutions and don't start by thinking that what you want to do is impossible, as happens in Italy.
5. You always know what people think, given the proverbial directness of the Dutch, a characteristic that many people don't like, though.

**C: Tell me 5 things you don't like about the Netherlands.**

**H:**

1. The food.
2. The climate.
3. People are definitely less sociable and warm compared to Italy or South Africa.
4. Generally there is a little more racism than I expected. It's subtle but it's there. I was certainly aware that not all Dutch people were extremely tolerant, but I see more racism and a sense of "white supremacy" than I thought.
5. I can't think of a fifth thing right now.

**C: Tell me 5 things you miss about Italy.**

**H:**

1. My friends.
2. The food.
3. My house.
4. My job.
5. Italians.

**C: Do you think moving here was the right thing for your daughters' future?**

**H:** Yes, 100%. I have no doubts.\
Not only do I think they have better opportunities here, but I also believe that the resilience and endurance they are learning in facing this situation are providing them with excellent tools for the future.

**C: Okay, but this is not only about the Netherlands. If we had moved to Afghanistan, would that have been even better then?**

**H:** No, of course not, but if we had moved to Canada, England, or Ireland, for example, it might have been easier or maybe harder, we don't know. So my answer is not only about the Netherlands, but about our decision, regardless of the country.

**C: What do you believe is positive, for your daughters' future, about having come specifically to the Netherlands?**

**H:** I believe there is a lot of diversity here. They are exposed to many different nationalities, different mentalities and lifestyles, again, these are not specific to this place but certainly a fundamental part of the Dutch experience. A huge thing is definitely the fact that they can freely and safely cycle wherever they want.

**C: Do you like your new job?**

**H:** No!\
Although I still see it as a completely new experience, it's fine for now, I see it as a short-term solution just to make money. It's not like my previous job, which I loved. I am learning a lot about people and the corporate world, which are good things to learn.

**C: Do you think you will live in the Netherlands forever?**

**H:** No. I don't really see myself living anywhere forever. I hope to grow old living in different places and exploring the world.

**C: Do you ever dream of going back to live in South Africa?**

**H:** Of course. Again, when I think with my heart, yes, 100%, but when I think with my head, I'm not so sure.

Our chat ended here because we have to go to an appointment to view a house available for rent from mid-February. The house is bigger than the one we are in now at a much lower price. Unfortunately, it is not located in Leiden but in "Alphen aan den rijn", a town about fifteen kilometres from Leiden.

We hope they give it to us!
