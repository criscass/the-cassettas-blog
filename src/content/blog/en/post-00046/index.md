_A bit of an exaggeration, obviously._

We had left off with me starting this new adventure as the chef at the South African restaurant Paarl, located at the Van der Valk Hotel in Sassenheim.\
The honeymoon lasted only a few days, immediately followed by a cold shower and an impending divorce.\
Let me explain.\
I immediately noticed the low quality of the dishes we were serving, and, aware that we would be changing the menu soon, I reassured myself thinking I could improve things and put a bit of pride into what I was doing.\
I was wrong.\
The restaurant is managed by the hotel owner's son, who is in turn the son of the owners of all the Van Der Valk hotels, the largest hospitality chain in the Netherlands, including hotels, restaurants, and supermarkets.\
They are one of the richest families in the Netherlands. Despite this, Mark, the manager of Paarl, is not an arrogant, billionaire's son in his twenties, but someone who works hard and gets his hands dirty: he truly amazed me in this respect.\
The problem is intrinsic to the hotel's basic philosophy: reducing costs to a minimum while maintaining very high efficiency and modest prices for customers. In the kitchen, this translates to: extensive use of industrially processed ingredients, a preference for quantity over quality, and the employment of a lot of students as service staff.\
I found myself having to send out dishes that I am quite ashamed of, and, as an Italian, this is a continuous stab to the heart.\
The fact that we have so many twenty-year-olds with their first kitchen experience means they have no frame of reference for other ways of understanding gastronomy, and the fact that they are all Dutch makes the problem worse.The Netherlands is, as far as I know, the place with the worst culinary culture in the world.\
For the Dutch, daily meals are a purely logistical matter. Their approach to food is utilitarian. To eat as much as possible with the least expense and in the shortest time.The English, for example, who are also infamous (in my opinion unfairly) for bad cuisine, are much more capable of appreciating good food, in between drinks.\
Obviously, these are generalizations. I believe a Dutch person with a refined palate exists somewhere, but they are very well hidden because I haven't met them yet.However, the reason for the great disappointment is not solely the fault of the Hotel's philosophy; it is also my fault.\
In the past, I worked in a couple of kitchens in New York in the late nineties, when I was a disciple of Sri Chinmoy, in a situation completely detached from reality, where the approach to work was directly related to spiritual goals. The restaurants were owned by other adherents, all the staff were disciples, we meditated before and after service, and everyone worked with calmness, peace, and awareness. This was possible because most of us didn't even take a salary, just room and board, since what mattered was self-realization and pleasing the master.\
Then, in the early 2000s, I worked closely with kitchens in England, making sandwiches and cold dishes, working behind a pub counter, or being a waiter, so I never truly experienced real work in a kitchen.\
Then fifteen years at La civettaia, where I managed the kitchen myself to serve a maximum of a dozen guests. I bought all the ingredients, of the highest quality, at their expense, and I had all the time to work with peace and tranquility. And outside the large kitchen window, there was a fantastic landscape and the chirping of birds.\
Having never watched programs like Masterchef or TV series about the restaurant world, I haven't even had that kind of exposure, even though it is distorted by television requirements.My idealization of the chef's profession quickly had to face the harsh reality of what happens behind a restaurant's stoves. The chaos that is generated from the moment the first orders arrive until the end of service is fun two or three times, then it becomes stressful and quickly turns into a nightmare that keeps you awake at night.\
I have woken up several times in the middle of the night, in the grip of a nightmare where an important ingredient has run out and no one knows what to do, and everyone is looking at you because you are the chef, and you have to find a solution immediately. Then I can't fall back asleep because my brain, uncontrollably, is already organizing the next day's "$$mise\ en\ place$$" (preparation). Years of meditation and concentration techniques thrown to the wind. My mind is like an unmanageable teenager.\
You will therefore understand that I soon began to devise an escape route.\
I am looking for another job... any job.\
Hilly is trying to convince me to try another kitchen, in a quieter place, where maybe I can change my mind. She is afraid that I will start working somewhere else and then, after a few months, I'll want to change again, driven by a passion for the stove. How can I blame her!\
I'm not sure. This experience is giving me a good dose of PTSD toward all restaurants.\
Another factor that disturbs me enormously is the enormous daily waste of ingredients. Entire gastronoms (standard containers used in catering) of food in perfect condition thrown into the bin without any shame. This is a scourge of all restaurants, with few exceptions. By design, you must always have more ingredients than necessary, in case of mistakes during service, or for guests who did not book. According to HACCP hygiene standards, when an ingredient is thawed, its life is reduced to a few days, and if it is then heated, it can no longer be put back in the fridge. These rules are obviously necessary to avoid contamination, but, for the purpose of doing everything faster and always having everything ready to be served in a few minutes, you always end up, at the end of the evening, with containers full of food in the rubbish bin.This is exacerbated if you work for a large restaurant that must have more extra portions available, and if the restaurant needs to keep personnel costs low, there is also less time to organize and manage ingredients more carefully.\
This matter bothers me even more than the low quality of the dishes. I have never tolerated waste of any kind, and I am considering not eating in restaurants anymore for this reason, not that eating out here in the Netherlands is a pleasant thing like in Italy anyway.\
Last week I sent several CVs for jobs as a bicycle mechanic, carpenter, gardener, handyman technician, and similar things. By the end of next week, in fact, Luigi will go to work for another Van der Valk Hotel, and they have assigned me a seventeen-year-old Sous-Chef with whom I already worked one day, when we had few customers, together with Luigi, and she seems very unmotivated and certainly not autonomous.\
Tomorrow Luigi will not be there, and it will be just her and me in the kitchen, with 60 guests already booked, which is a lot for Paarl. It's going to be a mess, I hope I get out alive!\
I plan to do three blog episodes soon of the type: "An interview with Hildegard Viljoen," "An interview with Sophia Cassetta," and "An interview with Gemma Cassetta," in which I will ask them questions about how their life is going here, in the country of flowers, bicycles, and junk food.

_This is just a small portion of the food we threw away last week during an event that started with 220 guests, then reduced to 150._
