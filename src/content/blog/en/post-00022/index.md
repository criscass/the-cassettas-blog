_An Image Perhaps a Bit Exaggerated but Representative_

In May 2009, our family situation had some similarities with today. I was concluding a two-year work experience with Google, and Hilly was on a summer break from the English school where she taught from October to May. An unpaid summer break, of course.

My job with Google wasn't the kind of computer engineering role that allows you to bring home a six-figure annual salary by furiously typing on a keyboard between ping-pong games and chats on colorful sofas. No, it was rather a low-level digital labor job where I had to analyze the content of web pages they loaded onto a portal to see how relevant they were to the searched keywords.

It was an underpaid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_Turk" target="_blank">mechanical Turk job</a> , without any rights or career opportunities. In two years of work, I had never spoken to anyone. All my contacts were limited to email exchanges with the Irish office and wire transfers to my bank account. That job was ending anyway because every two years the big brother from Mountain View would fire everyone doing my job and hire new people, for a series of reasons I won't list now.

Sophia was turning one year old on June 21 and was completely unaware that she had two unemployed parents with no savings. When we left Milan in July 2007, my parents gave us a large gift derived from the sale of the apartment we had lived in for two years. Hilly's parents also gave us money, matching what my parents had given us, and we found ourselves with fifty thousand euros, which we quickly invested in an apartment in the province of Pisa, taking out a thirty-year mortgage, just a few months before the real estate market crash, to buy a house at a price that today, almost twenty years later, would allow you to buy one twice as large.

To use an understatement, our prospects were not rosy.

We started looking on various sites for a "Agriturismo" to manage. I was studying Agricultural Sciences at the University of Pisa, in my second year, and wanted to work in agriculture. We both had experience in hospitality. So it seemed like a good idea.

When we were told there was a beautiful place in the countryside between Pontedera and Volterra, where an English family was looking for a couple to manage their vacation home, we didn't waste any time and went to meet the English caretakers who were about to return to the other side of the Channel.

We immediately fell in love with the place, and when we were told that if we passed the interview with the owners, we would both be hired regularly and wouldn't even have to pay rent, it seemed too good to be true.

The interview with the owners was to take place three weeks later when they came for a vacation for a week. During those three weeks, it was a daily torture trying not to think about how our lives could change if we got the job.

The house we would be living in was a huge upgrade compared to the apartment in Crespina. The job also promised well. I was tired of spending my evenings at the computer as a flesh-and-blood appendage of a huge and cold algorithm, and Hilly was fed up with trying to teach English to the uninterested and yawning municipal police officers of Pisa who were only there because the course was paid for by the municipality and took place during working hours.

This weekend is a shorter and much lighter version of those three weeks.

The stakes are evidently lower, sure, and our work situation has nothing to do with it, but it's also true that now we have two teenage daughters who will start school in a month in a language they don't know and who need a minimum of stability.

So, between yesterday and today, we are limiting our daydreams and trying to talk about it as little as possible to avoid major disappointments, hoping that tomorrow the real estate agency will give us the good news, thus greatly easing the light but constant underlying anxiety that, given our situation, obviously afflicts us.
