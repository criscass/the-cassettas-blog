_Waiting for the Uber_

This morning at 6:25 we took an Uber to go to Christina's apartment. We needed to be there by 7:00 and we couldn't make it by public transport since it's Sunday and the first bus from Huizen leaves after 7:00.

With the Uber, we arrived in 35 minutes; the streets were deserted and the sky was clear.

Christina is an epidemiologist, half American and half German, who has been living in Amsterdam for almost ten years. Her apartment is quite small (33 m2) but very cozy. It is located not far from Rembrandtpark, west of the center of Amsterdam.

Once we said goodbye to Christina, who was leaving for Florida, we went out for a walk with JJ, the dog. Then Sophia returned to the apartment and I headed back to Huizen. Liz, in fact, will arrive only this evening around 22:00 and we agreed that I will stay at home until around 20:00, so as not to leave Bob and Morris alone for too long.

One thing we immediately noticed in these days, taking the bus several times, is that every single person who gets off the bus exchanges thanks with the driver. No matter the age of the passenger, even the youngest do it.

For all public transport, trains, subways, buses, etc., we use a rechargeable card that is used for check-in when boarding and check-out when getting off. You can also use your credit card directly.

Yesterday around noon we went for a long walk with Bob, we crossed a forest along the shores of the lake. Then in the afternoon Bob was tired and slept for 4 hours snoring the whole time like a human being, what a character!

In a few hours, I'll say goodbye to Bob and Morris and join Sophia in Amsterdam. But first I have to wash the sheets and clean the house a bit.

I just finished developing this blog and now I'm putting it online. I will try to write regularly and will send a message when there's a new post. I would have liked to add a section for your comments, but that requires quite a bit of work and now I need to focus on finishing the portfolio (I'm almost there) and start contacting some companies.

See you soon.

_If we had a few more days, I'm sure Morris would have let himself be pampered._
