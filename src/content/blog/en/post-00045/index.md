_Luigi and I in the kitchen_

Things are going swimmingly at the South African restaurant.

It's a nice change from my previous job, where I spent my days fixing bikes and discussing everything with Joost, a formidable conversational partner and an inexhaustible source of technical knowledge on two-wheeled vehicle mechanics and electronics. Now the work is undoubtedly more hectic and tiring, but at the same time stimulating, fascinating, and fulfilling.

Luigi taught me everything there was to know about the current menu, but it will change soon, on the 23rd of this month. Roger, the Hotel's executive chef, asked me to take a look at what they've created and possibly suggest modifications or change some dishes completely.

The day before yesterday, both Hilly and I had the day off, and we started doing some experiments. One of them is a dessert, which I must say didn't turn out badly, although we still need to perfect it. It's a panna cotta served in a small transparent glass, topped with a cinnamon and ginger-flavored Rooibos tea jelly, and a candied fruit—probably a slice of candied orange or mandarin, or pineapple, to have a better color contrast with the red of the Rooibos.

Anyway, Roger liked the idea, and before launching the new menu, Luigi and I will prepare a tasting of all the dishes for the owner, Mark, and also for Roger. Then in February, we'll change the menu completely, and I'll have to do that one all by myself, although I can reuse dishes I've made in the past, perhaps making some small modifications.

Obviously, I could never do it without the help of my wife and the family in South Africa, who continue to encourage me and give me a lot of essential information and advice.

_A day of culinary experiments with Hilly_

We are still looking for another place to live. I expected to have already moved out of this house a while ago, but finding an alternative is proving to be very difficult. Every day I check several websites, and from time to time, I find something that might work for us—meaning it has 3 bedrooms, no matter how small, and isn't too far from Leiden. I immediately send an email with all our details, how much we earn, the types of work we do, etc., but I can never even get an appointment to visit the apartment.

Last week, for the first time, I managed to schedule a viewing. Friday morning, at 9:00, Hilly and I are going to see a house in Voorschoten, a town not far from Leiden, a 25-minute bike ride from the center, in the direction of The Hague. The house doesn't look bad at all; in fact, it seems too good to only cost €1700 a month (I remind you that we currently pay €2200). I already went to see it from the outside a few mornings ago, and the reasons I think it costs so little are because it borders a supermarket parking lot (so there's a constant stream of cars beyond the garden hedge) and because it has the lowest energy efficiency rating, G.

Despite everything, we'd still take it, but I don't think we have much hope since it was recently given "under option" status on Funda (the biggest website for houses for sale and rent in the Netherlands), which means a possible tenant has been found, and negotiations are underway between the parties. Anyway, Hilly and I are still going to the appointment with the agency tomorrow morning, and then we'll see.

This week Gemma is taking a lot of exams at school and is quite stressed. In the Netherlands, unlike in Italy, there are no oral exams, only written tests, which are all done within the space of a week, during different periods of the year, usually 2 or 3.

After this week, however, she will go for a 5-day internship at her former school as an assistant. She could have gone to many other places for the internship besides schools; she chose to go there because she misses that environment, her friends, and the teachers.

Sophia also often remembers how nice it was to go to the ISK (the state international school) and would like to go back. Last night at dinner, she was also complaining about how unfairly stressful school is in general, and how it will then lead to having to go to a job, and that will also be stressful, so what's the point of it all?

I tried to explain to her that a long time ago, we woke up in the morning and had to go find food, hoping not to be devoured by wild animals, and the little we found we had to bring back to the village to feed our families, hoping to find them still alive. That, too, even if in a different way, was stressful. This is the human condition.

But returning to the present, if we do a little bit every day, with consistency and passion, trying to do our best but without being victims of the anxiety of failure, then we start to find a bit of meaning, and the stress becomes manageable.

I don't know if Sophia understood me.
