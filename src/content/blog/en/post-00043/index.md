_Together with Koen and Joost for a farewell beer_

Today at 2:00 PM, I'm doing a trial shift at the South African restaurant.\
Yesterday was my last day working at the bike shop. It's been eleven fantastic months, during which I learned a lot about bicycles and repaired hundreds of them, of every type and model.\
These skills will surely be very useful to me in the Netherlands, and elsewhere.
I also made some friends, and working at Reijneveld Rijwielen was never tiring or monotonous.\
After a beer with Koen and Joost, yesterday I cycled the route from the shop to home for the last time, thinking about all the times I had covered those 21 km, in every season and weather condition.\
I'll miss that road too.\
But there will be a new road to travel, even if it's shorter.\
New colleagues to meet, many things to learn, and new perspectives for the future.\
However, I have to admit that this time I haven't planned everything perfectly. If they decide not to hire me today, I'll be unemployed. But in the hospitality world, there are plenty of opportunities here in the Netherlands, so in the worst-case scenario, I still think I would find something quickly.\
I want to write another post in the coming days where I'll update you on the result of this fateful day.\
Wish me luck!
