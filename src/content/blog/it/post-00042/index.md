We are an Italian/ South African family recently relocated to the Netherlands from Italy.

We are writing to you concerning our eldest daughter, Sophia Cassetta. In 2024 she completed her second year of “Liceo Artistico” in Italy (roughly equivalent to the 3rd year of VWO). When we arrived here in July 2024 we enrolled her in the ISK da Vinci College Leiden, based on advice from various sources. Because she was raised speaking 3 languages, one of which is Afrikaans, she quickly moved from a level A1 Nederlands to B2. 

We have been told by her teachers that she only has one option, to go to MBO-4 and after that progress to HBO. 

She has always been a good student and achieved high marks in all her subjects.

Her levels of maths and English are quite high for her age and we think spending 1 or 2 years in a VWO or HAVO, before being able to go to HBO, would be a much better choice for her.

She intends to become an Architect.

We understand that because of her age, ( she is turning 17 in June) the rules don’t allow her to join the last years of VWO or HAVO but we are worried it wouldn’t be a good fit for her to go to an MBO-4, because the MBO-4 program may be too focused on practical work, and it would take three to four years, whereas we believe she would benefit more from an academically oriented school until she is ready for HBO or Universiteit.

As parents, it saddens us to see how disheartened she becomes after every open day we attend, hearing how much longer her path to higher education is becoming. This is especially difficult after she was so excited and eager to come to the Netherlands for better educational opportunities.

We would like to have a conversation with you about this situation. Please let us know if you would be available for an appointment.

Hildegard Viljoen and Cristian Cassetta
